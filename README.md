# Health Catalyst Technical Interview Challenges
This repository contains coding challenges to help us evaluate your technical knowledge and skills in a few specific areas. There are 3 challenges for each major category (ruby, rails, SQL).

## Instructions
1. Create a branch called `solutions` and commit all changes to that branch
1. Choose a challenge from the section below based on current skill level, and follow the the instructions in the README for that challenge
1. Repeat for each skillset (rails, ruby, sql - see outline below)
1. Once complete, zip the entire repo and email to your contact at Health Catalyst
    1. Preferably, use `tar -czf technical-interview-challenges-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz technical-interview-challenges`, replacing `YYYY-MM-DD` with the current date

## Outline of skillset / challenges
Choose the challenges appropriate for your skill level in each of the technologies listed below.

The challenges can be completed in 1 day or spread over 3 days if preferred.

If any challenges seem too difficult or are taking too long based on time estimates below, consider committing the work-in-progess code and writing in the `notes.md` file:
- Design and implementation ideas
- Challenges you ran into
- Learnings from any mistakes made that cost a lot of time

Some of the challenges are related, but each one can be completed on its own.
